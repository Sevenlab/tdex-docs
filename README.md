### What is TDEX Project

TrueDEX aims to create a global peer to peer network with an open interface for market makers to signal liquidity in different asset pairs and for traders a faster, non Â­custodial and anonymous way to exchange assets.
To do that, we take advantage of the UTXO model and then the underlying capability of Elements Based networks to perform automated swaps, without the need of a trusted third party.
The system is built on top of TSWAP protocol - a protocol to interact within peers and performs swaps in an automated and pseudo-anonymous fashion - and  uses a distributed network of liquidity providers providing an open interface for seamless exchange of Liquid assets. 
We believe in the freedom of speech, of transacting, and humankind empowerment through technology. We want to help build a world which enables individuals to use freedom-enabling technologies, as they see fit, without asking anyone for permission. 

This is the reason why we have been developing TDEX as free software.
